# ComplexPasswordGenerator
Hey there! This was just a project I did for fun over here. Continue reading for more info.

So this "ComplexPasswordGenerator" generates a complex password by taking a random letter each from 4 words inputted by the user and 5 random numbers between the range of 1-10, then places them together.

You can either generate a password or fetch a password for an account.

Just run `generator.py` and follow what the terminal says, enter `generate` to generate a new password of type in `passwords` to fetch any password of any account / website / etc.
